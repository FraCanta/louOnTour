Volterra holds an immense treasure trove of art, archaeology, and craftsmanship; in fact, it is famous for alabaster work, a knowledge that has been handed down for generations.

Most of the photos you have seen of the Tuscan landscape were taken in this very area! The valley is crossed by the Orcia River from which it takes its name. Here the absolute protagonist is nature so much so that today it is a protected park and has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Scattered in this landscape we find medieval castles, ancient villages, abbeys each with its own history and particularity. Val d'Orcia is also a land of excellent wines such as the most famous Brunello di Montalcino or Rosso d'Orcia and many others. For our tour (about 6 hours) I propose you to visit together these villages that I am sure you will fall in love with:",

Along the main streets are elegant Renaissance palaces, Piazza Grande, characteristic views and vantage points overlooking the Val d'Orcia and in particular the vineyards that produce the famous Nobile. Further down the valley is the Temple of San Biagio, a place of worship and example of 16th-century Tuscan Renaissance architecture designed by Antonio da San Gallo the Elder.</p>"

The interior is striking because of the singular vault and because in the center of the room is the rock in which Saint Galgano thrust his sword. Attached to the church is the 14th-century chapel with frescoes attributed to Ambrogio Lorenzetti. Fifty years later, further down the valley, the abbey named after St. Galgano was built by the Cistercians. The earliest example of Gothic architecture in Tuscany and one of the most evocative places in the Sienese countryside. The skeleton of the abbey remains, testifying to the power and wealth of the monastic community. A ruin completely immersed in the contrasting colors of the sky and the surrounding nature, a vision of solitary and dramatic beauty. ",
